    <p>Aerobics is a form of physical exercise that combines rhythmic aerobic exercise with stretching and strength training routines with the goal <br>
        of improving all elements of fitness (flexibility, muscular strength, and cardio-vascular fitness). It is usually performed to music and may <br>
        be practiced in a group setting led by an instructor (fitness professional), although it can be done solo and without musical accompaniment. <br>
        With the goal of preventing illness and promoting physical fitness, practitioners perform various routines comprising a number of different <br>
        dance-like exercises. Formal aerobics classes are divided into different levels of intensity and complexity and will have five components:<br></p>
        <li>warm-up (5–10 minutes),</li>
        <li> cardiovascular conditioning (25–30 minutes),</li>
        <li> muscular strength and conditioning (10–15 minutes), </li>
        <li>cool-down (5–8 minutes) </li>
        <li> stretching and flexibility (5–8 minutes).</li>
        <p> Aerobics classes may allow participants to select their level of participation according to their fitness level. Many gyms offer different<br>
          types of aerobic classes. Each class is designed for a certain level of experience and taught by a certified instructor with a specialty <br>
          area related to their particular class.</p>
