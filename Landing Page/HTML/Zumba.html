<p>
    Zumba is one of the best-known fitness organizations in the world, with more than 200,000 class locations available in 180 countries.<br>
     And while the brand is best known for its signature "Zumba" Latin dance fitness class, the company offers several additional workout <br>
     formats, from strength training to kid's fitness classes and even water aerobics classes.
<br>
    Each workout involves highly choreographed movements set to upbeat salsa and international music. Essentially, Zumba is a fun, high-energy <br>
    workout experience that keeps you excited to exercise and return for more.
<br>
Classes typically consist of Latin-inspired songs, starting with a slower warm-up song, building intensity throughout the workout, and ending <br>
with a cool-down song. Even if you're not a strong dancer, the choreography is repetitive and designed to be built upon, so most people will<br>
 catch on to the moves as they go.</p>
